Welcome to the Kanban Board Application! This project, built with React JS, provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks effectively. It connects seamlessly with the API at Quicksell API [https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment], allowing users to customize their workflow by grouping and sorting tasks according to their preferences.

## Features

- Organize tickets by Status, User, or Priority.
- Arrange tasks in descending order of Priority or alphabetically by Title.
- User preferences are saved in local storage, ensuring that your settings are retained even after refreshing the page.
- A visually appealing layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.
- Priority levels are defined as Urgent (4), High (3), Medium (2), Low (1), and No priority (0).
